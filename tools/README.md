# 🧭 Penetration Testing Tool Learning Roadmap

This roadmap lists essential penetration testing and Kali Linux tools in the **order you should learn them**, moving from foundational knowledge to more advanced topics like exploitation, social engineering, and digital forensics.

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Foundations & Reconnaissance
Start with core networking and scanning tools.

- [Nmap](nmap.md) – Network mapping and port scanning
- [Wireshark](wireshark.md) – Packet analysis and protocol inspection
- [Lynis](lynis.md) – System auditing and hardening
- [Nikto](nikto.md) – Web server scanning
- [Skipfish](skipfish.md) – Web application vulnerability scanning
- [WPScan](wpscan.md) – WordPress vulnerability scanning
- [Maltego](maltego.md) – OSINT and relationship mapping

---

## 🔐 Phase 2: Enumeration & Brute Force
Dig deeper into services, users, and brute-force attacks.

- [Gobuster](gobuster.md) – Directory and DNS brute-forcing
- [Hydra](hydra.md) – Brute-force login attacks
- [Netcat](netcat.md) – Manual service interaction and shell handling

---

## 💥 Phase 3: Exploitation
Use automated frameworks and exploits to gain access.

- [Metasploit Framework](metasploit.md) – Exploitation and payload delivery
- [SQLMap](sqlmap.md) – SQL injection testing and data extraction
- [BeEF](beef.md) – Browser exploitation

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Phase 4: Post-Exploitation & Credential Cracking

- [John the Ripper](john.md) – Password hash cracking
- [Snort](snort.md) – Detecting network attacks and anomalies
- [Yersinia](yersinia.md) – Layer 2 protocol attacks

---

## 📡 Phase 5: Wireless & Mobile Security

- [Aircrack-ng](aircrack-ng.md) – Wireless hacking and WPA cracking
- [Apktool](apktool.md) – Reverse engineering Android apps

---

## 🎭 Phase 6: Social Engineering & Phishing

- [Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)](setoolkit.md) – Crafting social attacks
- [King Phisher](king-phisher.md) – Phishing campaign simulation

---

## 🧪 Phase 7: Digital Forensics

- [Autopsy Forensic Browser](autopsy.md) – File system analysis and investigation

---
